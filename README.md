# Rugplay Enhanced

## Soooo  
*i don't know at all how to use github*
I made an extension cos rugplay players are almost all annoying.  

It's available in:  
- French  
- English  
- Portuguese (Brazilian) <sub>*(4 u Felipe üëç)*</sub>
- Japanese  
- Kana Japanese  

The extension is a mix of things related to comments. It was made while usernames were not truncated.  

It:  
- Truncates usernames that have more than 15 chars  
- Blocks usernames and words in a community-based blacklist  
- Has Easter egg  

As said, ~~I~~ *(Cloudflare)* hosts a database which is just a big list of banned users and words.  

> [!CAUTION]
> The server has a maximum of 100,000 requests per day. If someone tries to reach the limit or adds garbage to the list, I will simply add a whitelist and rate-limit the server.
